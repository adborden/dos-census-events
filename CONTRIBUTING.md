# Contributing

Welcome! Thank you for considering a contribution to our project. Census Events
is a project of [OpenOakland](https://www.openoakland.org/), part of the Brigade
Network under Code for America.

If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request
anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change
something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its
LICENSE, and its [README](./README.md).


## Code of Conduct

OpenOakland is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community
for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member
in any form. By participating, you agree to our full [Code of
Conduct](https://openoakland.org/code-of-conduct/).


## Pull requests

Please submit a pull request for any commits, large or small. Pull requests are
a great way to get visibility on changes and keep folks up to date. Please keep
your pull requests of a reasonable size as large pull requests can take longer
to review and merge.

For UI changes, please include screenshots to help reviewers.

Once approved, the author may merge the Pull Request.
