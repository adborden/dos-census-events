Welcome!

Census Events helps residents find events and resources in preparation for the
2020 Census.

Census Events was created by [OpenOakland](https://openoakland.org/), a team of
volunteers, part of the [Brigade Network](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org)
under [Code For America](https://www.codeforamerica.org).


## How to get Census Events for your County
